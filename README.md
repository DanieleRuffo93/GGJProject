# Global Game Jam Project 2025

Welcome to our game project for the **Global Game Jam 2025**, developed using Unreal Engine 5 (version 5.5.1).

## Branching Strategy

To ensure stability and smooth development:
1. The `main` branch should always contain a **stable version** of the game.
2. For new features, create a **dedicated branch** focused on that specific functionality. Use the convention `feature/name_of_the_feature` in order to keep the repo as tidy as possible.
3. Regularly **merge the `main` branch into your working branch**, especially before merging your branch back into `main`.
